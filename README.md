# Consumer-Complaints-Classification
This is a Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing based project, where the task is to automate the mapping of complaint narratives to their respective department.

The database has been taken from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) website -
https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/

This repository consists of two files. One for data cleaning and reduction (because it is a huge dataset and enough computation power was not available), and the other for the implementation of NLP libraries and ML algorithms.

Note: The results are not very good as only basic ML algorithms were applied. Some ideas to improve the results could be to use neural networks, hyperparameter tuning, normalization, regularization, transfer learning, etc.
